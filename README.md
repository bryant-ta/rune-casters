Rune Casters is an online multiplayer PvP game where players build spells from different rune shapes. It mixes fast paced action with block puzzle mechanics in a hectic battle for 4 players over network connection. Clever use of the 4 spell types - Fireball, Speed, Shield, and Wall (but donâ€™t forget punching!) - and efficient block placement will see your wizard to the top of the magical world!

Note: This game was created with Photon Free Tier with 20 CCU (concurrent users). If more than 20 players are connected, then other players will be unable to connect to their servers to play.
